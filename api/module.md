# Package org.avmedia.translateapi
Dynamic Resource Translation API

## Description
This Android library simplifies internationalization for your app. You only need to create
a single `strings.xml` file in your native language (not necessarily English), and the library will
automatically translate your app into the system language set on the user's phone.


*All the API functions are located in the **[DynamicTranslator]** class.*

For a quick start, you can take a look at the `/app` directory of this project for an example app.
